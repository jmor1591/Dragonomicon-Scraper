Target: One creature or object
Duration: 1 round/level
An invisible ray projects from your fingers.You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.The target, if struck, functions as if it were inside an antimagic field.If this spell is used against a creature, the target can't cast spells or can't use supernatural or spell-like abilities, nor do such abilities have any effect on the creature.However, the creature can still use spell completion items (such as scrolls) or spell trigger items (such as wands), even though it can't cast the spells required.If this spell is used against an object, that object's magical powers are suppressed—including any spells previously cast and currently in effect on the item, as well as any spells or magical effects targeted on the object during the antimagic ray's duration.Remember that an object struck by the ray only receives a saving throw if it is attended or if it is a magic item.An unattended item, even if currently under the effect of a spell (such as a torch with continual flame cast upon it), receives no save.The spell doesn't affect any objects other than the target itself, even if those objects are worn, carried by, or in contact with the target.For instance, if a creature is the target, its equipment remains unaffected.Material Component: A pinch of iron filings mixed with ruby dust worth 100 gp.

Target: Your breath weapon
Duration: Instantaneous
Choose one type of energy other than that normally associated with your breath weapon: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.You can modify your breath weapon to add an equal amount of the energy you choose.For example, a wyrm red dragon whose breath weapon normally deals 22d10 points of fire damage could use this spell to produce a cone dealing 22d10 points of fire damage plus 22d10 points of acid damage.Even opposed types of energy, such as fire and cold, can be combined using this spell.The modification applies only to the breath produced as part of the casting.When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electricity, or fire energy, it is a spell of that type.For example, breath weapon admixture is an acid spell when you cast it to add acid damage to your breath weapon.

Cheat
Level: Bard 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1, Greed
Components: V, S, AF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute/level or until used
At one point during the duration of this spell, you can attempt to alter the outcome of a game of chance.This spell can only affect nonmagical games, such as those using cards or dice.It cannot affect a game involving magic, nor a magic item involved in a game of chance (such as a deck of many things).Whenever a roll is made to determine the outcome of the game, a character under the effect of this spell may demanda reroll and take the better of the two rolls.For example, Darkon is playing a game that he has a 1 in 4 chance of winning.The DM secretly rolls 1d4 and tells the player that Darkon lost.Because Darkon is under the effect of a cheat spell, the player can have the DM reroll.The spell alters probability, so there is no subterfuge that another character could notice (except for the casting of the spell itself ).Focus: A pair of dice made from human bones.

Cloak of Bravery

Contingent Energy Resistance
Level: Cleric 4, Druid 4, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
This spell functions similarly to contingency, but with a more limited scope.While contingent energy resistance is in effect, if you are dealt damage associated with one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the spell automatically grants you resistance 10 against that type of energy for the remainder of the spell's duration (just as if you were under the effect of a resist energy spell of the appropriate type).Once the energy type protected against by a particular casting of this spell is determined, it can't be changed.You can't have more than one contingent energy resistance in effect on yourself at the same time—if you cast the spell a second time while an earlier casting is still in effect, the earlier spell automatically expires.The energy resistance granted by this spell does not stack with similar benefits against the same energy type (such as from the resist energy spell).However, it is possible to be simultaneously under the effect of resist energy (fire) and contingent energy resistance (electricity), or any other two such spells that protect against different types of energy.Material Component: A pearl worth at least 100 gp.

Death Dragon

Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Personal
Target: 
Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Dispelling Breath

Components: S, MB
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: Your breath weapon
Duration: Instantaneous
Your breath weapon acts as a targeted dispel magic, possibly dispelling magical effects affecting creatures caught in its area.The modification applies only to the breath produced as part of the casting.For each creature or object that fails its saving throw against your breath weapon and that is the target of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature.A dispel check is 1d20 + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the spell's caster level.A creature's magic items are not affected, and creatures and objects that rolled successful saving throws against your breath weapon are likewise not affected.If a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), is in the area and fails its saving throw against your breath weapon, you can also make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the creature (returning it whence it came).For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the area of your breath weapon, you make a dispel check to dispel the spell.You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 minute/level (D)
You hamper the subject creature's ability to fly (whether through natural or magical means) for the duration of the spell.If the target fails its saving throw, its fly speed (if any) becomes 0 feet.An airborne creature subjected to this spell falls to the ground as if under the effect of a feather fall spell.Even if a new effect would grant the creature the ability to fly, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the earthbind spell.If the target makes a successful Fortitude save, its fly speed (including any new effect granted during the spell's duration) is reduced by 10 feet per caster level (maximum reduction 100 feet at 10th level).This reduction can't bring the creature's fly speed down to less than 10 feet.Earthbind has no effect on other forms of movement, or even on effects that might grant airborne movement without granting a fly speed (such as jumping or levitate or air walk spells).

Energy Immunity
Level: Cleric 6, Druid 6, Sorcerer 7, Wizard 7
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 24 hours
This abjuration grants a creature complete protection against damage from whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.Energy immunity absorbs only damage.The recipient could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning results from a lack of oxygen), being deafened by a sonic attack, or becoming encased in ice.The effect of this spell does not stack with similar effects, such as resist energy and protection from energy, that protect against the same energy type.If a character is warded with energy immunity (fire) and is also receiving resistance to fire from one or more of the other spells, the energy immunity makes the other spells irrelevant.However, it is possible to be simultaneously under the effect of energy immunity (fire) and resist energy (electricity), or any other two such spells that protect against different types of energy.

Enervating Breath
Level: Sorcerer 8, Wizard 8
Components: S, MB
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: Your breath weapon
Duration: Instantaneous
You can modify your breath weapon so that it is laced with negative energy.In addition to the normal energy damage your breath weapon deals, creatures that fail their saving throws against the breath weapon gain 2d4 negative levels.The modification applies only to the breath produced as part of the casting.If the subject gains at least as many negative levels as it has Hit Dice, it dies.Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties: -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities).Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from her highest available level.Negative levels stack.Assuming the subjects survive, they regain lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level.Ordinarily, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the subject's level, but the negative levels from enervating breath don't last long enough to do so.If an undead creature is caught within the breath weapon, it gains 2d4×5 temporary hit points before taking damage from the breath weapon.If not immediately lost, these temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

Entice Gift
Level: Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2, Greed
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Duration: 1 round
You enchant a creature so that it feels suddenly compelled to give you what it is holding when you cast this spell.On the creature's next action, it moves as close to you as it can get in a single round and offers you the object as a standard action.This spell allows you to act out of turn and accept the "gift"if the creature reaches you to hand you the object (assuming you have a free hand and can accept it).The subject defends itself normally and acts as it wishes on subsequent rounds, including attempting to get the object back if desired.If the subject is prevented from doing as the spell compels, the spell is wasted.For example, if the subject is paralyzed and cannot move or drop the item, nothing happens.
